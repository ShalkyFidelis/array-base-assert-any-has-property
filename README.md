## API Reference

### `hasProperty(array, property)`

- **Parameters**:
  - `array`: An array of objects to be checked.
  - `property`: A string representing the property name to check for.

- **Returns**: 
  - `true` if at least one object in the array has the specified property.
  - `false` otherwise.

### Example

```javascript
const array = [{ name: 'Alice' }, { age: 30 }, { job: 'Engineer' }];
console.log(hasProperty(array, 'name')); // true
console.log(hasProperty(array, 'salary')); // false
```

## Examples

Here are a few more examples to illustrate how the utility works:

### Example 1: Checking Own Properties

```javascript
const array = [{ name: 'Alice' }, { age: 30 }, { job: 'Engineer' }];
console.log(hasProperty(array, 'job')); // true
```

### Example 2: Checking Inherited Properties

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const array = [new Person('Alice', 30), new Person('Bob', 25)];
console.log(hasProperty(array, 'age')); // true
```

### Example 3: No Matching Property
